Sorting algorithm
Big O notation
Sorting algorithms animations
15 sorting algorithms in 6 minutes (WARNING: The following video can trigger seizure/epilepsy. It is not required for the project, as it is only a funny visualization of different sorting algorithms)
CS50 Algorithms explanation in detail by David Malan
All about sorting algorithms
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

General
At least four different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.
You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.
You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.
Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.
Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
Unless specified otherwise, you are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, … is totally forbidden.
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called sort.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
A list/array does not need to be sorted if its size is less than 2.
